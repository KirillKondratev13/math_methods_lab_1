"""
Script 3 â€” 03_train_model.py

Purpose:
- Load X_train, y_train, and the list of feature names from processed_data.pkl.
- Import and initialize catboost.CatBoostClassifier with verbose=0 for silent training and random_state=42.
- Train the model on X_train and y_train.
- Extract feature importances from the model's feature_importances_ attribute.
- Create a pandas DataFrame with columns: 'feature' (feature names) and 'importance' (their importances).
- Save this DataFrame to feature_importances.csv, sorted in descending order of importance.

Dependencies:
- pickle
- pandas
- catboost

Steps:
1. Import necessary libraries: pickle, pandas, catboost.
2. Load the data from processed_data.pkl using pickle. Expect a dictionary with keys 'X_train', 'y_train', and 'feature_names'.
3. Initialize the CatBoostClassifier with the specified parameters.
4. Fit the model on X_train and y_train.
5. Retrieve the feature importances.
6. Create a DataFrame with feature names and their importances.
7. Sort the DataFrame by importance in descending order.
8. Save the DataFrame to 'feature_importances.csv' without the index.
